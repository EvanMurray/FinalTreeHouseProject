This is a website designed to implement the MEAN Stack. 

You can create, read, modify, delete recipes, and search for recipes on the web. The recipe search can be used with single words for recipes such as, omelette. It can also be used with ingredients seperated by commas to search for recipes with the included ingredients. Creating and reading recipes requires a MongoDB connection on your local machine. This website is still a work in progress and still has a few bugs to be worked out.
